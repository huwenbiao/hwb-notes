.SH NAME
incm - Incorporating new mails for Mew
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
incm
.RI [ options ]
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B incm
utility incorporates new mails from the mbox or the maildir to
Mew's inbox folder.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP 8
.B \-a
Retrieve all mails from maildir/{cur,new} for maildir.
.TP 8
.B \-b
Backup mails.
mbox: No truncate mbox file.
maildir: To maildir/cur directory.
.TP 8
.BI \-c
Use the Content-Length: field, instead of the "From " line, 
as a mail separator for mbox.
.TP 8
.BI \-d " path"
Path to mbox/maildir.
If
.IR path
is a file, mbox is assumed. If
.IR path
is a directory, maildir is assumed.
.TP 8
.BI \-m " path"
The same as the
.B \-d
option.
.TP 8
.BI \-s
Read one mail from stdin instead of mbox/maildir.
.TP 8
.BI \-i " inboxdir"
A path to the inbox directory.
.TP 8
.B \-u
Don't touch ".mew-mtime".
.TP 8
.B \-f
Preserve Unix From (Envelope Sender) line in mbox case.
.TP 8
.BI \-p " mode"
Specify file mode that creates in mbox case.
.TP 8
.B \-o
Use the suffix when creating messages.
.TP 8
.BI \-x " suffix"
Use this 
.IR suffix .
.TP 8
.B \-h
Display this help message.
.TP 8
.B \-v
Display the version.
.PP
.SS mbox
For mbox, the mail separator is "From " in the beginning of lines.
The
.B incm
utility does not convert ">From " to "From " in the beginning of lines
in the body.
On Solaris, Content-Length: should be used with the 
.BI \-c
option to tell the end of mail.
.PP
To lock mbox, a lock file("<user>.lock"), 
flock() or lockf(), and open(O_EXLOCK) are used.
.PP
.SS maildir
For maildir, no lock and no separator are necessary.
.PP
Consider the following situation:
.nf
        cur/{1,2}
        new/{3,4}
.fi
.PP
Executing
.B incm
without the options results in:
.nf
        cur/{1,2}
        new/{}
        to inbox: {3,4}
.fi
.PP
Executing
.B incm
with the
.B \-a
option results in:
.nf
        cur/{}
        new/{}
        to inbox: {1,2,3,4}
.fi
.PP
Executing
.B incm
with the
.B \-b
option results in:
.nf
        cur/{1,2,3,4}
        new/{}
        to inbox: {3,4}
.fi
.PP
Executing
.B incm
with the
.B \-a
option and the 
.B \-b
option results in:
.nf
        cur/{1,2,3,4}
        new/{}
        to inbox: {1,2,3,4}
.fi
So, if both options are specified, 
messages are retrieved multiple times.
