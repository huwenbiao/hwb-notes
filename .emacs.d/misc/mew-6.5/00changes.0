0.99 (10/08/95) mew-release release

* Typo of mew-draft-multipart-end.
* Never display MIME syntax when mew-summary-toggle-disp-msg is on.
* I have misunderstand RFC1522 for a long time that its heder encoding
requires MIME-Version: field. But Keith kindly told me that it's not
the case. Thanks to this flexibility of RFC1522, we can safely exchange 
non-ascii header fields with non-MIME interface.
* Typo of update in mew-summary-rescan.
* mew-field-get-{value, line} now uses mew-loop-depth to prevent long
loop that happens with thousands of same field in a message.
* mew-prog-pick-default-arg is defined.
* edit-again and reedit inserts mew-from and mew-reply-to.
	Satoshi Nakagawa <nakagawa>
* mew-cite-format is *field free*! See the documentation of 
mew-cite-fields.
* mew-refile is version up to stop using
mew-summary-buffer-disp-msg-current.
* Many code contributions that make Mew slightly faster preventing
consumption of cells. Thanks!
	UMEMURA Akihiro <akihiro>
* Define mew-cite-prefix-function and mew-cite-prefix-username.
* Define mew-cite-prefix-confirmp.
* On Xemacs, use (mark t) instead of (marker-position (mark-marker)).
	Niclas Andersson <nican>
* mew-prog-audio bug fix (Sorry for late, Dave!).
	Shiro IKEDA <shiro>
	dcw (David Worenklein)
* mew-summary-reply prepares Cc: from From: field. This may be useful
in the case that To: is a user, From: is the sender, and Reply-To: is
a ML.
* Define mew-header-max-length to prevent long loop for processing
loooong header.
* mewencode hack.
  (1) "\n.\n" including "post soft break" is QP-encoded to "\n.=\n\n".
      (suggested by Richard Levitte <levitte>)
  (2) If we meet illegal encoded words such as "=XX" at PQ-decoding,
      we just warn, never exit.
      (suggested by Niclas Andersson <nican>)
* mew-header-extract-addr hack.
	Mine Sakurai <m-sakura>
* mew-mark-process-all-folders bug fix.
	Shiro IKEDA <shiro>
* "insert" rather than insert-after-markers which is obsolete in Emacs 19.
	Jarle Fredrik Greipsland <jarle>
* Draft menu enhancement.
	dcw (David Worenklein)
* mew-ask-cc hack for forward, multiforward, and resent.
	dcw (David Worenklein)
* Define message-mode functions and menu.
	dcw (David Worenklein)
* Use buffer-substring-no-properties instead of buffer-substring for 
mew-delete-backward-char[-at] on Emacs 19 for font-lock-mode.
	Jarle Fredrik Greipsland <Jarle.Greipsland>
* C-u C-c C-c on draft buffer leaves the draft as it is.

for security. 
* "mo" bug fix.
	Hirotaka Yokokawa <Hirotaka.Yokokawa>


0.97 (07/28/95) mew-release release

* mew-draft-check-whom uses mew-header-address-collect instead of 
mew-header-user-collect. 
	Tetsuro Muranaga <Tetsuro_Muranaga>
* Defined mew-temp-file to get rid of the security hole which makes
eavesdroppers possible to watch contents of mail on
/tmp. mew-temp-file must be a file which nobody but you can
access. The default value is ~/Mail/drafts.
* localform decoder and syntax analyzer now handle CT: in
Message/digest.  Message/Mixed and Message/Digest is syntactically
identical but the semantics are different. The default CT: for
Message/Digest is "message/rfc822" whereas the default CT: for
Message/Mixed is "text/plain". We don't assume null line after
boundary anymore.
* mew-pgp-decode-sentinel and mew-pgp-decode-sentinel-mime is merged to 
handle PGP message.
