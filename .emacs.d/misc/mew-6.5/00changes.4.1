* Clearing POP password if its connection times out.
* IMPORTANT NEWS.

  Information part of .mew-summary (after \r) changed. That is,
  folder-name is removed. This makes .mew-summary independent on its
  directory path.

  If you want to re-use current .mew-summary, try the "alpha/fix-sum"
  command.

* IMPORTANT NEWS OF IMAP:

  There are two kinds of IMAP servers. One allows folders under the
  root like "foo". The other allows folders under the "inbox" folder
  only. An example is "inbox.foo". So far, Mew has treated a folder
  name as is. So, with the server of the latter type, you had to
  specify a folder like "%inbox.foo". 

  This was very inconvenient.

  Mew now automatically checks the type of servers when typing "3 Z",
  which updates a list of folders. For the latter type, Mew now
  automatically expands, for example, "%foo" (a user view) to
  "inbox.foo" (IMAP level).

  So, you need to type '3 Z' once. When Mew find a list of folders is
  in the old format, Mew displays "type '3 Z'". So, take it easy.

  An old cache directory located in, for example, 
	~/Mail/.imap/user%port/inbox.foo
  and currently does in 
	~/Mail/.imap/user%port/foo
  for the latter type.

  If you want to reuse the old cache directories, "mv" them by
  yourselves. Try the "alpha/fix-imap" command.

  Remove "inbox." from 'mew-refile-guess-alist' and
  'mew-imap-trash-folder' in ".mew" if any.

  You may need to remove the following two files:
	~/Mail/.mew-refile-msgid-alist
	~/Mail/.mew-refile-from-alist
